1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,620
"Mom, who are these people?"

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,916
It was an innocent question
from my young daughter Anya

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,076
around the time when she was three.

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,196
We were walking along with my husband

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,996
in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,316
Anya was peering at a huge poster
standing tall in the middle of the mall.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,700
It featured the three rulers
of the United Arab Emirates.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,036
As she tucked in my side,

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,276
I bent down and explained
that these were the rulers of the UAE

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,556
who had worked hard
to develop their nation

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,820
and preserve its unity.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,716
She asked, "Mom, why is it
that here where we live,

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,396
and back in Lebanon,
where grandma and grandpa live,

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,556
we never see the pictures
of powerful women on the walls?

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,460
Is it because women are not important?"

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,676
This is probably the hardest question
I've had to answer in my years as a parent

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,140
and in my 16-plus years
of professional life, for that matter.

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,916
I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,396
the younger of two daughters
to a very hard-working pilot

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,036
and director of operations
for the Lebanese Airlines

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,860
and a super-supportive
stay-at-home mom and grandma.

22
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,876
My father had encouraged
my sister and I to pursue our education

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,196
even though our culture
emphasized at the time

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,220
that it was sons and not daughters
who should be professionally motivated.

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,836
I was one of very few girls
of my generation

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,260
who left home at 18 to study abroad.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,116
My father didn't have a son,

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,140
and so I, in a sense, became his.

29
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,396
Fast-forward a couple of decades,
and I hope I didn't do too badly

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,020
in making my father proud
of his would-be son.

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,636
As I got my Bachelor's and PhD
in electrical engineering,

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,500
did R&D in the UK,
then consulting in the Middle East,

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,780
I have always been
in male-dominated environments.

34
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,020
Truth be told, I have never found
a role model I could truly identify with.

35
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,822
My mother's generation
wasn't into professional leadership.

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,876
There were some
encouraging men along the way,

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,060
but none knew the demands
and pressures I was facing,

38
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,459
pressures that got particularly acute
when I had my own two beautiful children.

39
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:26,140
And although Western women love to give us
poor, oppressed Arab women advice,

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,740
they live different lives
with different constraints.

41
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,036
So Arab women of my generation
have had to become our own role models.

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,316
We have had to juggle more than Arab men,

43
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,700
and we have had to face
more cultural rigidity than Western women.

44
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,636
As a result, I would like to think
that we poor, oppressed women

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,140
actually have some useful,
certainly hard-earned lessons to share,

46
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,836
lessons that might turn out useful

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,420
for anyone wishing to thrive
in the modern world.

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,556
Here are three of mine.

49
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,436
["Convert their sh*t into your fuel."]

50
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,676
(Laughter)

51
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,500
(Applause)

52
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,476
There is this word that everybody
is touting as the key to success:

53
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,740
resilience.

54
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,380
Well, what exactly is resilience,
and how do you develop it?

55
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,620
I believe resilience is simply
the ability to transform shit into fuel.

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,276
In my previous job,
well before my current firm,

57
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,420
I was working with a man
we will call John.

58
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,636
I had teamed up with John
and was working hard,

59
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,636
hoping he would notice how great I was

60
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,980
and that he would come to support
my case to make partner at the firm.

61
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,036
I was, in addition to delivering
on my consulting projects,

62
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,220
writing passionately on the topic
of women economic empowerment.

63
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,740
One day, I got to present my research
to a roomful of MBA students.

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,956
John was part of the audience

65
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,620
listening for the first time
to the details of my study.

66
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,116
As I proceeded with my presentation,

67
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,340
I could see John in the corner of my eye.

68
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,356
He had turned a dark shade of pink

69
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,180
and had slid under his chair
in apparent shame.

70
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,116
I finished my presentation
to an applauding audience

71
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,220
and we rushed out and jumped into the car.

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,180
There he exploded.

73
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,036
"What you did up there was unacceptable!

74
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,260
You are a consultant, not an activist!"

75
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,876
I said, "John, I don't understand.

76
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,556
I presented a couple of
job gender parity indices,

77
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,635
and some conclusions about the Arab world.

78
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:32,635
Yes, we do happen to be today
at the bottom of the index,

79
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:35,860
but what is it that I said or presented
that was not factual?"

80
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,916
To which he replied,
"The whole premise of your study is wrong.

81
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,780
What you are doing is dangerous and will
break the social fabric of our society."

82
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,916
He paused, then added,

83
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,340
"When women have children,
their place is in the home."

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,436
Time stood still for a long while,

85
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,156
and all I could think and repeat
in the chaos of my brain was:

86
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,356
"You can forget about
that partnership, Leila.

87
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,952
It's just never going to happen."

88
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,396
It took me a couple of days to fully
absorb this incident and its implications,

89
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,060
but once I did,
I reached three conclusions.

90
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,516
One, that these were his issues,

91
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,036
his complexes.

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,116
There may be many like him in our society,

93
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,340
but I would never let
their issues become mine.

94
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,156
Two, that I needed
another sponsor, and fast.

95
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,396
(Laughter)

96
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,636
I got one, by the way,
and boy, was he great.

97
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,076
And three, that I would get to show John
what women with children can do.

98
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,516
I apply this lesson equally well
to my personal life.

99
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,316
As I have progressed in my career,

100
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,796
I have received many words
of encouragement,

101
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,116
but I have also often been met
by women, men and couples

102
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,876
who have clearly had an issue
with my husband and I

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,420
having chosen the path
of a dual-career couple.

104
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,516
So you get this well-meaning couple

105
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,796
who tells you straight out
at a family gathering

106
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,076
or at a friends gathering,

107
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,529
that, come on, you must know
you're not a great mom,

108
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:01,113
given how much you're investing
in your career, right?

109
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,236
I would lie if I said
these words didn't hurt.

110
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,716
My children are the most
precious thing to me,

111
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,420
and the thought that I could be
failing them in any way is intolerable.

112
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,836
But just like I did with John,

113
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,476
I quickly reminded myself
that these were their issues,

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,700
their complexes.

115
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,636
So instead of replying,

116
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,956
I gave back one of my largest smiles

117
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,836
as I saw, in flashing light,

118
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,996
the following sign in my mind's eye.

119
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,076
[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]

120
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,340
(Applause)

121
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,916
You see, as a young woman
in these situations, you have two options.

122
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,796
You can either decide
to internalize these negative messages

123
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,436
that are being thrown at you,

124
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,436
to let them make you feel like a failure,

125
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,036
like success is way too hard
to ever achieve,

126
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,476
or you can choose to see that others'
negativity is their own issue,

127
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,540
and instead transform it
into your own personal fuel.

128
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,876
I have learned
to always go for option two,

129
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,020
and I have found that it has taken me
from strength to strength.

130
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,076
And it's true what they say:

131
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,260
success is the best revenge.

132
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,196
Some women in the Middle East

133
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,636
are lucky enough to be married
to someone supportive of their career.

134
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,116
Correction: I should say "smart enough,"

135
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,516
because who you marry is your own choice,

136
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,140
and you'd better marry someone supportive
if you plan to have a long career.

137
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,356
Still today, the Arab man
is not an equal contributor in the home.

138
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,596
It's simply not expected by our society,

139
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,060
and even frowned upon as not very manly.

140
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,876
As for the Arab woman,
our society still assumes

141
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,636
that her primary source of happiness
should be the happiness and prosperity

142
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,596
of her children and husband.

143
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,060
She mostly exists for her family.

144
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,556
Things are changing,
but it will take time.

145
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,076
For now, it means
that the professional Arab woman

146
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,436
has to somehow maintain the perfect home,

147
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,556
make sure that her children's every need
is being taken care of

148
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,580
and manage her demanding career.

149
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,916
To achieve this, I have found the hard way

150
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,716
that you need to apply your hard-earned
professional skills to your personal life.

151
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,180
You need to work your life.

152
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,060
Here is how I do this in my personal life.

153
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:14,676
One thing to know about the Middle East

154
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,140
is that nearly every family
has access to affordable domestic help.

155
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,140
The challenge therefore becomes
how to recruit effectively.

156
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,276
Just like I would in my business life,
I have based the selection

157
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,356
of who would support me
with my children while I'm at work

158
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,580
on a strong referral.

159
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,036
Christina had worked
for four years with my sister

160
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,380
and the quality of her work
was well-established.

161
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,956
She is now an integral
member of our family,

162
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,580
having been with us
since Anya was six months old.

163
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,715
She makes sure that the house
is running smoothly while I'm at work,

164
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:48,955
and I make sure to empower her

165
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:52,156
in the most optimal conditions
for her and my children,

166
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,379
just like I would my best talent at work.

167
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,956
This lesson applies
whatever your childcare situation,

168
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,396
whether an au pair, nursery,

169
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,756
part-time nanny
that you share with someone else.

170
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,620
Choose very carefully, and empower.

171
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,196
If you look at my calendar,

172
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,196
you will see every working day

173
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,916
one and a half hours
from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time

174
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,900
blocked and called "family time."

175
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,156
This is sacred time.

176
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,580
I have done this
ever since Anya was a baby.

177
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,276
I do everything in my power
to protect this time

178
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,716
so that I can be home by then
to spend quality time with my children,

179
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,140
asking them about their day,

180
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,076
checking up on homework,
reading them a bedtime story

181
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,676
and giving them
lots of kisses and cuddles.

182
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,196
If I'm traveling,
in whatever the time zone,

183
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,700
I use Skype to connect with my children
even if I am miles away.

184
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,076
Our son Burhan is five years old,

185
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,660
and he's learning to read
and do basic maths.

186
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,316
Here's another confession:

187
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,076
I have found that our daughter
is actually more successful

188
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,996
at teaching him these skills than I am.

189
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,740
(Laughter)

190
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,676
It started as a game, but Anya loves
playing teacher to her little brother,

191
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,876
and I have found that these sessions
actually improve Burhan's literacy,

192
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,276
increase Anya's sense of responsibility,

193
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,276
and strengthen the bonding between them,

194
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,580
a win-win all around.

195
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,556
The successful Arab women I know

196
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,716
have each found their unique approach
to working their life

197
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,116
as they continue to shoulder

198
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,836
the lion's share
of responsibility in the home.

199
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,476
But this is not just
about surviving in your dual role

200
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,196
as a career woman and mother.

201
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,740
This is also about being in the present.

202
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,676
When I am with my children,

203
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,116
I try to leave work out of our lives.

204
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,156
Instead of worrying about how many minutes
I can spend with them every day,

205
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,956
I focus on turning these minutes
into memorable moments,

206
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,196
moments where I'm seeing my kids,

207
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,036
hearing them, connecting with them.

208
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,836
["Join forces, don't compete."]

209
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,636
Arab women of my generation
have not been very visible

210
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,756
in the public eye as they grew up.

211
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,676
This explains, I think, to some extent,

212
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,380
why you find so few women
in politics in the Arab world.

213
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,636
The upside of this, however,

214
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,756
is that we have spent a lot of time

215
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,220
developing a social skill
behind the scenes,

216
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,636
in coffee shops, in living rooms,

217
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,876
on the phone,

218
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,676
a social skill that is
very important to success:

219
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,356
networking.

220
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,036
I would say the average Arab woman

221
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,596
has a large network
of friends and acquaintances.

222
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,620
The majority of those are also women.

223
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,196
In the West, it seems like ambitious women
often compare themselves to other women

224
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,380
hoping to be noticed as the most
successful woman in the room.

225
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,956
This leads to the much-spoken-about
competitive behavior

226
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,300
between professional women.

227
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,556
If there's only room
for one woman at the top,

228
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,420
then you can't make room for others,
much less lift them up.

229
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,076
Arab women, generally speaking,

230
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,340
have not fallen
for this psychological trap.

231
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,036
Faced with a patriarchal society,

232
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,396
they have found
that by helping each other out,

233
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,660
all benefit.

234
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,116
In my previous job, I was the most
senior woman in the Middle East,

235
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,996
so one could think that investing
in my network of female colleagues

236
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,596
couldn't bring many benefits

237
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,876
and that I should instead invest my time

238
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,620
developing my relationships
with male seniors and peers.

239
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,140
Yet two of my biggest breaks
came through the support of other women.

240
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,476
It was the head of marketing
who initially suggested

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,796
I be considered as a young global leader
to the World Economic Forum.

242
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,796
She was familiar with my media engagements
and my publications,

243
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,916
and when she was asked
to voice her opinion,

244
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,180
she highlighted my name.

245
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,756
It was a young consultant,
a Saudi lady and friend,

246
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,516
who helped me sell
my first project in Saudi Arabia,

247
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,740
a market I was finding hard
to gain traction in as a woman.

248
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,156
She introduced me to a client,

249
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,316
and that introduction led to the first
of very many projects for me in Saudi.

250
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,796
Today, I have two senior women on my team,

251
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,060
and I see making them successful
as key to my own success.

252
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,116
Women continue to advance in the world,

253
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,516
not fast enough, but we're moving.

254
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,636
The Arab world, too, is making progress,
despite many recent setbacks.

255
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,276
Just this year, the UAE appointed
five new female ministers to its cabinet,

256
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,620
for a total of eight female ministers.

257
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,876
That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,

258
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,716
and more than many
developed countries can claim.

259
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,100
This is today my daughter
Anya's favorite picture.

260
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,676
This is the result,
no doubt, of great leadership,

261
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,316
but it is also the result
of strong Arab women

262
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,316
not giving up and continuously
pushing the boundaries.

263
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,476
It is the result of Arab women
deciding every day like me

264
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,276
to convert shit into fuel,

265
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,836
to work their life
to keep work out of their life,

266
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,900
and to join forces and not compete.

267
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,196
As I look to the future,

268
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,756
my hopes for my daughter
when she stands on this stage

269
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,596
some 20, 30 years from now

270
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,716
are that she be as proud
to call herself her mother's daughter

271
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,980
as her father's daughter.

272
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,316
My hopes for my son

273
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,956
are that by then, the expression
"her mother's son" or "mama's boy"

274
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,380
would have taken on
a completely different meaning.

275
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,156
Thank you.

276
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,888
(Applause)
